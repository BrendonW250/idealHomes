# idealHomes

Growing up in the Bronx and being in an environment where health isn't prioritized, it can be hard to find 
resources when you need them the most especially when it comes to finding nursing homes that treat people diagnosed with Dementia. 
idealHomes is intended to do just that where all the nursing homes that treat Dementia patients are listed so you won't have to scour
the internet. idealHomes will also give you the ability to share your own story and possibly relate to other people who have hard
a hard time finding the right home for their own circumstances.

# How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** Javascript, EJS, Nodejs, Express, Mongodb, Bootstrap, CSS, Passport

**Dependencies Used:** bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validato

In this app you have the ability to share your own story on how difficult it was for you to find a nursing home
that treats people diagnosed with Dementia as well as viewing other people's story on what they had to overcome

# Optimizations:

I would like to in the near future modify the database collection that holds all the information on each home by hopefully
providing more details on each nursing home. By doing this, I hope that it would make the user's life way easier due to the 
fact that all the necessary information they may need including insurance coverage and amenidies for residents can all be accessed 
through this website.


# Lessons Learned:

My greatest challenge in creating this project was to figure out how to display the data I collected about the nursing homes
from the database collection they were stored in to my EJS file while using the MVC architecture. Building this project definetly
helped in my understanding of how the MVC architecture can be incorporated into a project.
